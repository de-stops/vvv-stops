# vrn-stops

This is a simple script to download all [VVV](https://vogtlandauskunft.de) stops as [GTFS-compatible CSV](https://developers.google.com/transit/gtfs/reference/stops-file).

The script uses the following endpoint:

```
https://vogtlandauskunft.de/vvv2/XSLT_COORD_REQUEST?&jsonp=&boundingBox=&boundingBoxLU={minx}%3A{miny}%3AWGS84%5BDD.DDDDD%5D&boundingBoxRL={maxx}%3A{maxy}%3AWGS84%5BDD.DDDDD%5D&coordOutputFormat=WGS84%5BGGZHTXX%5D&type_1=STOP&outputFormat=json&inclFilter=1
```

It starts from bounding box `(5, 47, 15, 56)` and works down to smaller quadrants.

The script produces CSV output in the following format:

```
"stop_id","stop_name","stop_lon","stop_lat","stop_code"
"30200774","Schönberg (b Adorf), Schönberg, Wagenhalle",12.3072741523,50.1822231144,"de:14523:774"
```

# Usage

```
npm install
node index.js
```
